NMFS Openscapes is a multi-year collaboration between NOAA Fisheries and [Openscapes](https://www.openscapes.org/) to promote a data-driven culture through the adoption of open science initiatives: Fully Enable Open Science. Openscapes was named as a partner as the [Biden-Harris Administration announces $34 million to modernize NOAA Fisheries’ data, infrastructure and workforce](https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/biden-harris-administration-announces-34-million-to-modernize-noaa-fisheries-data-infrastructure-and) <!---to provide team-based training in reproducible scientific workflows and platforms--->. We have had 10 Openscapes Champions cohorts in 2020-2022 (400 staff! \[40 staff per cohort\]) involving all six science centers plus two regional offices, and began informally organizing as a mentor community. 

## NMFS Openscapes 3-year Framework and FY24 plan

As part of the NOAA Fisheries Data Modernization Strategy - funded for 3 years,  we plan to work with all six NMFS science centers, five regional offices, and the Office of Science and Technology. We have three synergistic Objectives:

1.  **Develop a mentor community**. We will develop a community of mentors across NMFS centers/offices. With Openscapes facilitation these mentors will learn and work together to strengthen Open Science skills at their center/office, co-create reusable resources for NMFS-specific scientific products, and empower their colleagues via local activities and trainings.
2.  **Empower scientific teams**. We will support center/office researchers to become high-functioning teams as they transition to Open Science and reproducible scientific workflows through the Openscapes' Champions and Pathways to Open Science programs and other Community Skill Building Workshops. Cohorts can include teams from the same or across centers/offices, or be topic specific (like stock assessment reports) to strengthen relationships and shared practices.
3.  **Amplify Open Science leaders**. We will amplify NMFS Open Science leaders and leverage synergistic efforts within NMFS and NOAA. We will focus on opportunities and recognition for staff who support their colleagues, which is critical to upskilling the NMFS workforce, deepening leadership capacity within NOAA, and connecting to the global Open Science movement.

**Aug-Sept 2024**: Openscapes Mentors FY24 Program Kick-off! Please see the [**Mentors Community Page**](https://nmfs-openscapes.github.io/mentors/activities.html) for more details about our schedule.

**October-December 2024**: Openscapes Champions cohorts. We are planning three simultaneous cohorts at science centers and regional offices much like in fall 2022.

## NMFS Openscapes FY22-23 {.minimal}

**July-September 2023**: Kick-off, engagement, planning, and coordinating for FY24. Bi-weekly meetings with the [FY23 NMFS mentors](https://nmfs-openscapes.github.io/mentors.html#mentors) to plan the year and identify strategic priorities and engagement. We also collaborated with Openscapes mentors across organizations – including NASA Earthdata, NOAA Fisheries, EPA, California Water Boards, Pathways to Open Science, Fred Hutch Cancer Center – to publish an article in *Ecology & Evolution*: [Shifting institutional culture to develop climate solutions with Open Science](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.11341). 

**January-June 2023** Bi-weekly mentor coach training with Tara Robertson, a DEI consultant and leadership coach who has [worked with Openscapes since 2021](https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2021/05/27/tara-robertson/). We are learning - how to ask open-ended questions, how to listen - that make us better equipped as mentors, teachers, and leaders. Blog post: [How coaching skills have made us better open data science mentors](https://openscapes.org/blog/2023-05-17-mentor-coach/).

**October-December 2022** Four Champions cohorts (150+ staff)! See the [Champions Cohort page](https://nmfs-openscapes.github.io/cohorts/#section).

## What is the impact of this?

What does shifting to open science look like across a federal agency like NOAA, and what are the impacts to the efficiency and quality of their scientific products? NOAA Fisheries colleagues share via a conference presentation and peer-reviewed publication:
