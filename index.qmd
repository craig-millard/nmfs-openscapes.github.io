NMFS Openscapes is a multi-year colloboration between NOAA Fisheries science centers and [Openscapes](https://www.openscapes.org/) to provide team-based training in reproducible scientific workflows and platforms. We have had 10 Openscapes cohorts in 2020-2022 (400 staff! [40 staff per cohort]), involving all six NOAA science centers plus two regional offices.

[Openscapes](https://www.openscapes.org/) champions open practices in environmental science to help uncover data-driven solutions faster. With tools specifically created to meet modern demands for collaborative data science, we help create a positive open culture to enable better science in less time.

## NMFS Openscapes FY23 {.minimal}

**July-September 2023**: Kick-off, engagement, planning, and coordinating for FY24. Bi-weekly meetings with the [FY23 NMFS mentors](https://nmfs-openscapes.github.io/mentors.html#mentors) to plan the year and identify strategic priorities and engagement. 

**January-June 2023** Bi-weekly mentor coach training with Tara Robertson, a DEI consultant and leadership coach who has [worked with Openscapes since 2021](https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2021/05/27/tara-robertson/). We are learning - how to ask open-ended questions, how to listen - that make us better equipped as mentors, teachers, and leaders. 

**October-December 2022** Four Champions cohorts (150+ staff)! See the [cohort webpage](https://nmfs-openscapes.github.io/cohorts/#section).
