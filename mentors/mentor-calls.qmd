We have five Mentor Calls as a full community. Here we detail the skills
and practices Mentors experienced and experimented with in each Call.

How might you reuse these? Moving from "open science from something I do
alone" to "open science is something I support in others".

## Call 1 Openscapes mindset for mentors

### What does it mean to be a mentor? What does Open Science at NMFS mean?

-   **Speaking up/sharing about yourself for 4 minutes** - a challenge
    for some to take up that space, a challenge for others to limit to
    that space.
-   **Keeping on time** - as a speaker and as a timekeeper
-   **Listening: giving space/silence. Not jumping in** - get
    comfortable with discomfort
-   **Live contributing to collaborative google doc** - hear from more
    voices than we could only out loud, both time-wise and due to power
    structures
-   **Learned emoji shortcut** - not frivolous; a way to connect, side
    conversations and encouragement to build relationships
-   **Saw us adjusting time on the fly in the doc and verbally** - open
    facilitation

### Your tasks before next Call

1.  **Seaside Chat:** Organize 1 hour with mentors at your center/office
    (or other people from other centers/offices), to discuss how you
    could improve workflows with open science in your own work, your own
    center, or more broadly. You could also discuss these readings 
2.  **Readings**: Read [Shifting institutional culture to develop
    climate solutions with Open
    Science](https://eartharxiv.org/repository/view/5948/) (2023
    preprint) and [How coaching skills have made us better open data
    science
    mentors](https://openscapes.org/blog/2023-05-17-mentor-coach/) (May
    2023), both coauthored by NMFS Mentors, (and \<20 mins combined). 
3.  **(optional) Attend** **Coworking**. We'll send a recurring calendar
    invite for the weeks between Mentors Calls, Tuesdays, 12:30 - 1:30
    pm PT. ([find your local
    time](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=NMFS+Openscapes+Mentors+Coworking&iso=20231024T1230&p1=1050&ah=1)).
    On Oct 24, Eli Holmes will report on PARR and the new 2022 memo and
    changes to our data workflows that are being proposed, and discuss
    how these changes will impact staff. (Eli is the NMFS Public Access
    of Research Results (PARR) representative on the NOAA PARR working
    group.)

## Call 2 Developing strong open and collaborative Communities

-   **Active listening and asking powerful questions** - coaching to
    empower people to find their own solutions rather than suggesting
    our ideas of what would help
-   **Vulnerability, yes! Shame, no** - learning and building trust by
    getting curious with each other
-   **Leveraging the experiences of a community** - Kathryn, Ady &
    Christine presenting
-   **You don't have to be an expert to teach** - Christine
    screensharing an efficiency tip she just learned
-   **Sharing open resources for reuse** - slides for 12-minute,
    5-minute, or 1-slide only presentations
-   **Crowdsourcing resources** - a list of NOAA & NMFS communities we
    recommend
-   **Making time for live clarification** -
-   **Bringing attention to or sharing gratitude for a colleague** -
    coaching kudos and examples of raising people up
