We have five Mentor Calls as a full community. Here we detail the skills
and practices Mentors experienced and experimented with in each Call.

How might you reuse these? Moving from "open science from something I do
alone" to "open science is something I support in others".

## Call 1 Openscapes mindset for mentors

**What does it mean to be a mentor? What does Open Science at NMFS
mean?**

-   **Speaking up/sharing about yourself for 4 minutes** - a challenge
    for some to take up that space, a challenge for others to limit to
    that space.

-   **Keeping on time** - as a speaker and as a timekeeper

-   **Listening: giving space/silence. Not jumping in** - get
    comfortable with discomfort

-   **Live contributing to collaborative google doc** - hear from more
    voices than we could only out loud, both time-wise and due to power
    structures

-   **Learned emoji shortcut** - not frivolous; a way to connect, side
    conversations and encouragement to build relationships

-   **Saw us adjusting time on the fly in the doc and verbally** - open
    facilitation
