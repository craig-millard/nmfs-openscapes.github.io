title: "NMFS Openscapes Mentor Community"
---

Starting in 2021, we have been growing an informal cross-NMFS mentor community; each science center and regional office participating in the Openscapes cohorts has 1-4 mentors that help organize the local cohorts, spearhead communication with with their local leadership, act as a point-person for interested local staff, help identify local needs, and help communicate, or potentially organize, teaching resources for their local staff. Openscapes organizes training and co-working sessions for the mentor group, so that we can all learn from each others experiences and learn new skills together.  

FY24 will kick off our formal Openscapes mentors cohort for the fiscal year. The  mentors cohort will help guide the Open Data/Open Science/Reproducibility efforts for their FMC and act as mentors for Champions cohorts. The mentors cohort will act as the "Open Science leadership team" for NOAA Fisheries. Participation is year-long and will include leadership and mentoring training. The mentor group is modeled after the [NASA Openscapes Framework approach](https://openscapes.github.io/approach-guide/mentors-framework).
