The NMFS Openscapes Mentor Community will be leading 3 Champions Cohorts in Fall 2024! Read on to learn what this is and how to sign up.

[SIGN UP FOR FALL](https://nmfs-openscapes.github.io/champions.html#sign-up-for-fall-2024)

## What is the Champions Program?

40 staff from across NMFS come together bi-weekly to work on goals related to data science workflows. Do you or your team have a ‘big goal’ that involves changing how you work and you want to make progress on making your data and science workflows more efficient and reproducible (however you define that)? Do you want to migrate to new data and science workflows, like cloud-based workflows, but don’t know how to get started? Do you want to connect with others across NMFS who are interested in Open Science, Open Data and Open Source? The Fall Openscapes Champions Cohorts are for you (and your team)! Make progress on those goals that seem so intangible and hard to get traction on by working in facilitated sessions with your peers and the Openscapes team. [Scroll the blogs](https://nmfs-openscapes.github.io/blog.html#category=champions) on what NMFS teams and individuals have accomplished in the 10 NMFS Champions Cohorts over the past 3 years.

Openscapes Champions is a remote-by-design, cohort-based mentorship program that helps teams re-imagine data analysis and stewardship as a collaborative effort, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive communities. It is focused on open science and data modernization via biweekly curriculum that Openscapes has improved over 24 Cohorts 2019-2024. The goal is strengthening a teaching and learning culture within teams and organizations. This program is not only for scientists: admin, IT staff, and beyond are welcomed. Individuals and teams do not have to have familiarity or expertise in open science or data science to benefit from the Openscapes Champions Program.

```{=html}
<!--- Through Openscapes cohorts, you focus on your own work with your peers or a team. As the program introduces modern concepts, tooling, and examples from your peers for collaborative open data science, groups focus on where you are and where you want to go together. **Openscapes Champions is "not your traditional training/workshop" because teams:**

-   Have real-world experiential learning: developing psychological safety and habits for implementing change
-   Learn together and get unstuck: Identify and make progress on barriers as Openscapes introduces modern concepts, tooling, and examples from peers
-   Work on what is important to them, often something hard to do. Something they want to change.

## Champions Program Details

**Fall NMFS Openscapes Champions Cohorts will run from October-December 2024!** We will meet as a cohort five times over two months, on alternating weeks, with additional optional coworking times.

-   **Date-Times**:
    -   **Cohort-A: Oct 8, 22, Nov 5, 19, Dec 3**. Alternating Tuesdays from 11:00am - 12:30pm PT.
    -   **Cohort-B: Oct 9, 23, Nov 6, 20, Dec 4**. Alternating Wednesdays from 10:00 - 11:30am PT.
    -   **Cohort-C: Oct 9, 23, Nov 6, 20, Dec 4**. Alternating Wednesdays from 1:00 - 2:30pm PT.
-   **Where:** remotely, via Google Meet
-   **What we learn:** [Champions program core lessons](https://openscapes.github.io/series), with NOAA Fisheries examples
-   **Cost:** Free; this opportunity is supported by NOAA funding to Openscapes
-   **Expected time commitment:** 8hrs/month for 2 months is a minimum expected time commitment. This accounts for 3 hours/month of synchronous Cohort Calls, optional Coworking hours, and team Seaside Chats where you plan with your research group to strengthen shared workflows.
-   **Who:** NMFS staff, affiliates, contractors, and others who are interested in improving their data science workflows. We aim to remove barriers to outside collaboration. It is important that those who participate can do so in all or most sessions, and are energized to be interacting with like-minded individuals across NOAA Fisheries. Sign up to participate individually, with a colleague or your team.

## Sign up for Fall 2024

**Sign up with a colleague or team by Sept 23, 2024 via [this Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10zTz6i-ZuwnQhCTG63jRku0BtVwgc9e1tqnfGuiyM2c/edit?gid=1241468325#gid=1241468325)**. Please indicate the Cohort date-times you are available; we will confirm participation via email by Sept 25.

### **What is a team?**

> How you define 'team' is completely up to you and having one person be in the cohort and using in-between session 'seaside chats' to bring back the information to another group is 100% fine. That is common in the cohorts. In my first Openscapes cohort, I was the only person from my project. My personal goal was to use the Openscapes structure to help a team that I am on figure out how to tackle some off-boarding tasks due to a retirement. During my second cohort, there were 2 team members in the cohort and 2 not in the cohort. We focused on standardizing our data to get ready for our GitHub served data package. For the 3rd cohort I am doing, 2⁄3 of our team is in the cohort as we start to get organized for a major revamp of our report into a reproducible workflow. - **Eli Holmes (NMFS Open Science, NWFSC, NMFS Openscapes)**

Teams do not need to be a formal research group; they can be collaborating in other ways. Team members do not all need to have technical or data interests, but share a curiosity and interest in improving something about how they work.

**Q: What if I don’t have a team?**

**A:** That’s ok, please sign up! We’ll help you connect with participants who share some of your goals or needs.

**Q: If a team is participating together, how important is it for them all to be in the same cohort?**

**A:** Not too important. Sometimes people feel more 'connected' if they see people they know in the virtual room. The activities during the cohort calls are not by 'team'; they are in random breakout groups. Participants are expected to have ‘Seaside Chats’ together with their teams in the weeks between Cohort Calls. It’s more important that participants are committed to attending all sessions in the time slot they have chosen.

**Q: Can I sign up if I have participated in a previous Openscapes Champions Cohort?**

**A:** Yes. If Cohorts are oversubscribed, this would be discussed by a small selection committee.

See [Frequently Asked Questions](https://openscapes.org/faq) for more guidance on teams.

### Examples from past participants

**Kourtney Burger, Biological Science Technician, SWFSC Acoustic Ecology Lab**. Kourtney participated in a PIFSC-SWFSC Cohort in Fall 2022. She shared her experience in a post for the NOAA Fisheries blog: [Sound Bytes: Championing Open Science](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/science-blog/sound-bytes-championing-open-science). In it, Kourtney describes how she transferred a field methods manual from a set of disparate files on Google Drive to a [Quarto web book on GitHub](https://sael-swfsc.github.io/adrift-field-methods/).

> “Seaside Chats with our SAEL team allowed those of us attending the Openscapes workshop to share our newfound knowledge and experience so we could make our science more open. During these sessions, we streamlined our science pathways, documented our methods through GitHub, and had general team strategy discussions.” - **Kourtney Burger (SWFSC)**

More examples to come.

## Mentor roles

The growing NMFS Openscapes Mentor community — staff from across NOAA Fisheries interested in supporting others with teamwork and open science — will be increasingly involved with Champions Cohorts, and point-people for questions about what is involved and how to sign up.

### Pre-cohort engagement

To share about the opportunity, our goal in September is to give a talk at each Center/Regional Office. Here are work-in-progress [slides introducing the Fall 2024 Champions Program](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1a_nDKAxpvaWURITBm_HiDvzCd7GLDmb8ooi-d0dRI5I/edit?usp=sharing) with background information we can all use to present.

### During cohort

Mentors participate in the Champions Program (in fact, Champions cohorts are scheduled as "takeovers" of regular Mentors calls to be mindful of Mentors' time commitments). Here are several roles where Mentors can contribute:

-   Participant (bring your team as Champions)
-   Mentor (Content expert, model live notetaking, contribute to debriefing)
-   Guest teacher - running a themed Seaside Chat, or (learn to) lead GitHub clinics
-   Helpers - Coworking / Seaside Chat (fix merge conflict, add documentation)
