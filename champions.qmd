title: "Openscapes Champions Cohorts"

Together with the NMFS Mentor Community, Openscapes will be leading 3 Champions Cohorts in Fall 2024! Read on to learn what this is and how to sign up. 

Co-leads: Eli Holmes (NMFS Open Science), Julia Lowndes (Openscapes).

## "Not your traditional training/workshop"

**What is the Champions Program?** 

Openscapes Champions is a remote-by-design, cohort-based mentorship program that helps teams reimagine workflows, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate inclusive collaborations with their colleagues. It is focused on open science and data modernization via biweekly curriculum that has been improved over 24 Cohorts 2019-2024 (including 10 with NMFS!) The goal is strengthening a teaching and learning culture within teams and organizations. This program is not only for scientists: admin, IT staff, and beyond are welcomed.

Champions is "not your traditional training/workshop" because:

- Real-world experiential learning: developing psychological safety and habits for implementing change
- Learn together and get unstuck: Teams identify and make progress on barriers
- Teams work on what is important to them: often something hard to do. Something they want to change. 

## Champions Program Details

**Fall NMFS Openscapes Champions Cohorts will run from October-December 2024!** We will meet as a cohort five times over two months, on alternating weeks, with additional optional coworking times. 

- **Date-Times**: 
  - **Cohort-A: Oct 8, 22, Nov 5, 19, Dec 3**. Alternating Tuesdays from 11:00am - 12:30pm PT. 
  - **Cohort-B: Oct 9, 23, Nov 6, 20, Dec 4**. Alternating Wednesdays from 10:00 - 11:30am PT. 
  - **Cohort-C: Oct 9, 23, Nov 6, 20, Dec 4**. Alternating Wednesdays from 1:00 - 2:30pm PT.   

-   **Where:** remotely, via Google Meet
-   **What we learn:** [Champions program core lessons](https://openscapes.github.io/series), with NOAA Fisheries examples 
-   **Who:** Teams of NMFS staff interested in improving their workflows and/or open science — goals do not need to be well-defined (we'll develop goals throughout the 10 weeks). Teams can also be collaborating in other ways and do not need to be a formal research group. If you are interested but think "I don't have a team" - you are welcome to sign up as an individual, or invite someone you know to sign up with you, even if you do not work on a shared deliverable! Your team can include feds, contractors, and others, so long as they can commit to the time.
-   **Cost:** Free; this opportunity is supported by NOAA funding to Openscapes
-   **Expected time commitment:** 8hrs/month for 2 months is a minimum expected time commitment. This accounts for 3 hours/month of synchronous Cohort Calls, optional Coworking hours, and team Seaside Chats where you plan with your research group to strengthen shared workflows.

## More background

From Eli Holmes, NMFS Open Science Lead: 

> The Openscapes curriculum teaches psychological safety skills, team bonding and empathy skills, framed in the context of data-intensive science. It teaches practical ways to do this in one's day to day interactions with the team and with others. **Why**? The goal is to help teams improve their workflows or tackle another big hard task. This requires that people be able to talk openly about issues and be vulnerable by discussing things that they or the team struggles with. Also the whole team needs to be able to do this. Psychological safety is needed for less ‘powerful’ or privileged members to feel empowered and safe. It is also needed for team leaders to be able to discuss their own limitations and lack of knowledge. **How**? In addition to the curriculum, teams tackle a specific project that they decide is important for their work, and have opportunities to cowork with others around particular data science themes.


## Mentor roles

### Pre-cohort engagement
Our goal in September is to give a talk at each Center/Regional Office Here are work-in-progress [draft slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1a_nDKAxpvaWURITBm_HiDvzCd7GLDmb8ooi-d0dRI5I/edit?usp=sharing) with background information we can all use to present.

### During cohort

Mentors participate in the Champions Program (in fact, Champions cohorts are scheduled as "takeovers" of regular Mentors calls to be mindful of Mentors' time commitments). Here are several roles where Mentors can contribute: 

- Participant (bring your team as Champions)
- Mentor (Content expert, model live notetaking, contribute to debriefing)
- Guest teacher - running a themed Seaside Chat, or (learn to) lead GitHub clinics
- Helpers - Coworking / Seaside Chat (fix merge conflict, add documentation)
