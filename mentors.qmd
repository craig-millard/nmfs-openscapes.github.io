title: "NMFS Openscapes Mentors"
---

The Openscapes Mentor group is a cross-NMFS mentor community. Each science center and regional office participating in the Openscapes cohorts has 1-4 mentors that help organize the local cohorts, spearhead communication with with their local leadership, act as a point-person for interested local staff, help identify local needs, and help communicate, or potentially organize, teaching resources for their local staff.

Openscapes organizes training and co-working sessions for the mentor group, so that we can all learn from each others experiences and learn new skills together.

# Mentor Cohort Activities 

## 2023

We have proposed a 3-year collaboration with NOAA Fisheries modeled after the [NASA Openscapes Framework approach](https://openscapes.github.io/approach-guide/mentors-framework) that would start in July 2023. Continuity is important for  community building and skillbuilding and we have been supporting mentors in early 2023 to maintain momentum.   

Below are Openscapes' past, ongoing, and planned activities to support inclusive open practices in research at NOAA Fisheries.

### October-December

Through facilitation and practical training for mentoring, teaching, and coaching, Openscapes will help NMFS mentors strengthen skills and strategies to support colleagues with diverse comfort levels with software and coding, while also strengthening relationships across centers/offices. Through this, mentors will identify and co-create on common resources and activities – such as code or databases for identical tasks or community developed standard practices – so there is less reinventing at each center. 

We will meet remotely twice monthly and also collaborate asynchronously (e.g. Google Chat, GitHub). Mentors will also focus on teaching NMFS colleagues through Champions cohorts and Community Skills Workshops, with support from Openscapes staff. 

#### Proposed timeline & topics  

- **Dates: Biweekly starting October 17, 2023** 
- **Times: 10:00 - 11:30am PT / 1:00 - 2:30 pm ET**
- **Location: Remotely, via Google Meet**

Agendas are accessible to Cohort participants in our Cohort Google Folder (link upcoming); they are also an archive of our live notetaking. Seaside Chat topics are to reflect with your other center mentors in-between cross-center cohort calls 

Date | Cohort Call Topics          |       Seaside Chats topics
----| ----------------------|--------------------------------
10/17 | 1. Openscapes mindset: better science for future us | Reflect together on what needs/challenges are common
10/31 | 2. Common needs; documentation | Prepare for GitHub & Quarto Clinics
11/14 | 3. GitHub & Quarto Clinics: project management & automated reports | Decide what mentor cohort will work on and what you'll work on
11/28 | 4. Team culture and data strategies for future us | Prepare for Champions cohorts in Feb-March
12/12 | 5. Open communities and coding strategies for future us | Coordinate & engage participants for Champions cohorts


### July-September

This will be a kick-off, engagement, planning, and coordinating stage. We will use our standing bi-weekly meetings we have with the NMFS mentors to plan the year and identify strategic priorities and engagement.

We will reach out to center/office managers with a welcoming description of our project and ask them to share a nomination form with people in their group who are working with Open Science practices and interested in peer-teaching and collaborating within NMFS. Opting in is a critical first investment from both managers and staff; this work will have clear expectations (e.g. 8 hours/month) and be in alignment with their jobs. Mentors will initially build from the pool of NMFS staff that have participated in Openscapes Champions cohorts in 2020-2022. We aim for 3 total mentors from each science center and regional office each year. 

We will also start identifying cross-center roadblocks that mentors can collaborate on throughout the next years. 

### January-May

From January-May through our bi-weekly meetings we are learning coaching skills with Tara Robertson, a DEI consultant and leadership coach who has [worked with Openscapes since 2021](https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2021/05/27/tara-robertson/). We are learning valuable coaching skills - how to ask open-ended questions, how to listen - that make us better equipped as mentors, teachers, and leaders. When listening as a coach, we're trying to help the other person define their problem and find their solution, outside of our expertise. This is different from mentoring, when we do have an answer within our expertise. Developing these coach listening skills, what questions to ask, and when to use mentoring vs coaching skills, is the focus of our sessions; we are practicing coaching skills together to tackle common challenges and skill-build together.

Our mentor-coach sessions are cross-government, and include Openscapes mentors working within and across their own institutions.

## 2022

### July-August

The NMFS Openscapes mentor group is meeting bi-weekly. Current focus is on activities surrounding the summer cohorts at SEFSC and Cal EPA.

### Spring 

Mentors and other interested folks across science centers and regional offices met several times to plan and give presentations about NMFS Openscapes efforts to individual science centers and the NMFS Science Board.

### January-March

The AFSC Mentors met bi-weekly during the 2021-2022 AFSC cohort.
