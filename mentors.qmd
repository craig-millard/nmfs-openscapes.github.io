title: "NMFS Openscapes Mentor Community"
---

Starting in 2021, we have been growing an informal cross-NMFS mentor community; each science center and regional office participating in the Openscapes cohorts has 1-4 mentors that help organize the local cohorts, spearhead communication with with their local leadership, act as a point-person for interested local staff, help identify local needs, and help communicate, or potentially organize, teaching resources for their local staff. Openscapes organizes training and co-working sessions for the mentor group, so that we can all learn from each others experiences and learn new skills together.

# Mentor Community Activities 

## FY24 Oct 2023 to Sept 2024

FY24 will kick off our formal Openscapes mentors cohort for the fiscal year. The  mentors cohort will help guide the Open Data/Open Science/Reproducibility efforts for their FMC and act as mentors for Champions cohorts. The mentors cohort will act as the "Open Science leadership team" for NOAA Fisheries. Participation is year-long and will include leadership and mentoring training. The mentor group is modeled after the [NASA Openscapes Framework approach](https://openscapes.github.io/approach-guide/mentors-framework).   

### October-December 2023: NMFS Mentors Cohort!

Through facilitation and practical training for mentoring, teaching, and coaching, Openscapes will help NMFS mentors strengthen skills and strategies to support colleagues with diverse comfort levels with software and coding, while also strengthening relationships across centers/offices. Through this, mentors will identify and co-create on common resources and activities – such as code or databases for identical tasks or community developed standard practices – so there is less reinventing at each center. 

The FY24 mentor cohort will start with a mentors-only Openscapes Champions cohort (facilated bi-weekly group meetings) during which Openscapes will guide the mentor cohort in discussing the needs and challenges for adoption of Open Science in NMFS and to develop actions to take. The facilitated meeting are vitual and twice monthly. Mentors will also collaborate asynchronously (e.g. Google Chat, GitHub). During the fall session, mentors will also learn and practice coaching and mentoring skills in preparation for the winter Champions cohorts.

#### Proposed timeline & topics  

- **Dates: Biweekly starting October 17, 2023** 
- **Times: 10:00 - 11:30am PT / 1:00 - 2:30 pm ET**
- **Location: Remotely, via Google Meet**

Agendas are accessible to Cohort participants in our Cohort Google Folder (link upcoming); they are also an archive of our live notetaking. Seaside Chat topics are to reflect with your other center mentors in-between cross-center cohort calls 

Date | Cohort Call Topics          |       Seaside Chats topics
----| ----------------------|--------------------------------
10/17 | 1. Openscapes mindset: better science for future us | Reflect together on what needs/challenges are common
10/31 | 2. Publishing and project management | Prepare for GitHub & Quarto Clinics
11/14 | 3. GitHub & Quarto Clinics: project management & automated reports | Decide what mentor cohort will work on and what you'll work on
11/28 | 4. Team culture and data strategies for future us | Prepare for Champions cohorts in Feb-March
12/12 | 5. Open communities and coding strategies for future us | Coordinate & engage participants for Champions cohorts

We will also start identifying cross-center roadblocks that mentors can collaborate on throughout the next years. 

### January-June 2023

From January-May through our bi-weekly meetings we are learning coaching skills with Tara Robertson, a DEI consultant and leadership coach who has [worked with Openscapes since 2021](https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2021/05/27/tara-robertson/). We are learning valuable coaching skills - how to ask open-ended questions, how to listen - that make us better equipped as mentors, teachers, and leaders. When listening as a coach, we're trying to help the other person define their problem and find their solution, outside of our expertise. This is different from mentoring, when we do have an answer within our expertise. Developing these coach listening skills, what questions to ask, and when to use mentoring vs coaching skills, is the focus of our sessions; we are practicing coaching skills together to tackle common challenges and skill-build together.

Our mentor-coach sessions are cross-government, and include Openscapes mentors working within and across their own institutions.

## 2022

### July-August

The NMFS Openscapes mentor group is meeting bi-weekly. Current focus is on activities surrounding the summer cohorts at SEFSC and Cal EPA.

### Spring 

Mentors and other interested folks across science centers and regional offices met several times to plan and give presentations about NMFS Openscapes efforts to individual science centers and the NMFS Science Board.

### January-March

The AFSC Mentors met bi-weekly during the 2021-2022 AFSC cohort.
